This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<h1>SmallTalk</h1>
=================================================================================
Taking advantage due quarantine I am updating my Github Profile, because the last 6 years i was basically coding for some software consulting companies but under <b>propietary</b> license policies.  So I don't have something of public domain or completely accessible.
So i will create some small/medium projects with (A2,react,vue,node js)

About the project

This is a simple project which comsumes some public Apis provided by 
https://pixabay.com/api/docs/  & https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php 
to show some usefull information using hooks from React 16.8 

Any Suggestion or something just send me a message and sorry for the UI/UX i am a bad designer but i am doing this also to enhance my poor UI skills .
