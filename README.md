This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## SmallTalk

Taking advantage due quarantine I am updating my Github Profile, because the last 6 years i was basically coding for some software consulting companies but under **propietary** licenses.  
So I don't have something of public domain or completely accessible that's why i am creating some small/medium projects with (A2,react,vue,node js)



# About the project

This is a simple project which comsumes some public Apis provided by 
[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) & [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) 
to show some usefull information using hooks from React 16.8 

Any Suggestion or something just send me a message to jjaulisr@gmail.com and sorry for the UI/UX i am a bad designer but i am doing this also to enhance my poor UI skills .

# Run the project

Just npm run start
